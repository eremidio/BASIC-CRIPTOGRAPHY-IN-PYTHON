# BASIC-CRIPTOGRAPHY-IN-PYTHON
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS TWO PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN PYTHON. ONE OF THESE ENCRYPT A MESSAGE
CONTAINED IN A FILE USING A LIST OF CHARACTERS, IT SAVES THE ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IN A SECOND
FILE AND GENERATES A KEY IN A THIRD FILE. THE KEY CAN THEN BE USED BY A SECOND PROGRAM TO DECRYPT
THE MESSAGE (THIS HAS TO BE DONE MANUALLY). THE PROGRAMS USES ONLY STANDARD PYTHON LIBRARY. THE
CRIPTOGRAPHY PROCESS USES A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR, THUS ASSURING THAT KEY IS UNIQUE AND 
GENERATED AT RUN TIME. WHEN THE SAME MESSAGE IS ENCRYPTED SEVERAL TIMES, IT GENERATES DIFFERENTS
CYPHERS AND DIFFERENT KEYS AT EACH TURN, THUS ADDING AN EXTRA LEVEL OF SECURITY.
